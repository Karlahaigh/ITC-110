1)  [] is an empty list which contains no value (similar to '')

2)  spam[3] = 'hello'

3)  spam[int(int('3' * 2)/11)] evaluates to 'd'

4)  spam[-1] evaluates to 'd'

5)  spam[:2] evaluates to ['a', 'b']

6)  bacon.index('cat') evaluates to 1

7)  bacon.append(99) adds 99 to the end of the list: [-3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8)  bacon.remove('cat') removes the first iteration of 'cat' from the list: [-3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9)  The operator for list concatenation is + and the operator for list replication is *

10) The append method adds the new value to the end of the list, whereas the insert method places it in a specified position in the list

11) The two methods for removing values from a list are the del (delete) method and the remove method

12) lists and strings can be concatenated and replicated, used in for loops, used with the in and not in operators, and 
can be passed to len()
u
13) Tuples are immutable - the values cannot be modified, appended, or removed

14) Place a trailing comma after the value inside the parenthesis: (42,)

15) Tuple form of list value: tuple(['cat', 'dog', 5])
    List form of Tuple value: list(('cat', 'dog', 5))
    
16) They contain references to list values

17) The copy.copy() function will copy a list, but a copy.deepcopy() function will copy the list and any list within that list
