Reading - ATBSWP 1-28 and (p.28 1-8 checked into Github, checked by group. Hello world in your private repos)

1. Of the items listed *, -, /, and + are operators while 'hello', -88.8, and 5 are values

2. spam is a variable and 'spam' is a string

3. Three data types: Integers, Floating-point numbers, and Strings

4. An expression is made up of values and operators which evaluate or reduce to a single value.

5. Expressions contain values and operators and reduce to a single value, whereas an assignment statement stores variables and consists of a variable name, an equal sign, and the value to be stored.

6. After running the code: bacon=20; bacon +1   The variable bacon would contain the value of 21.

7. The expressions 'spam' + 'spamspam' and 'spam'*3 should both evaluate to spamspamspam

8. eggs is a valid variable because it is only one word and does not begin with a number, while 100 is a number thereby making it invalid as a variable.

9. The functions are str(), int(), and float()

10. The expression 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritos' causes an error because you cannot add or concatenate integers and strings. You have to make the integer into a string: 'I have eaten' + str(99) + 'burritos.'
11.
