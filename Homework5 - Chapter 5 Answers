Chapter 5 Answers

1.)	Empty dictionary = {}

2.)	Dictionary with a key ‘foo’ and value 42: dictionary={‘foo’:42}

3.)	The main difference is that lists are ordered while dictionaries are not.

4.)	If spam={‘bar’: 100} and you try to access spam{‘foo’} you will get keyError: ‘foo’

5.)	There is NO difference between the expression ‘cat’ in spam and ‘cat’ in spam.values() – the in and not in operators will check for its presence.

6.)	‘cat’ in spam checks if there is a keyword of cat in spam while ‘cat’ in spam.values() will check if ‘cat’ is one of the values stored in spam

7.)	The shortcut for that code is the setdefault() method:
Spam.setdefault(‘color’, ‘black’)

8.)	The pprint module and the pprint.pprint() function
